		About this application	
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		This application was designed as part of a final project for an university course('PRC- Processamento e Representação de Conhecimento').
	</p>
	<p>

		The objective of this app is to explore the ontology created for this project by the student, whose domain is chemical elements and molecules.
	</p>
	<p>
		Both the ontology and the locations of the original data can be found in the project(https://github.com/Ezequiel-Moreira/PRC_projeto_final) in a folder separate from the servers used for this application.
		
	</p>
	<p>
		WARMING: due to the data format that was processed by the ontology, some of the entities in the ontology are not well represented
